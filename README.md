After finishing the remake of two other classic games to Roku platform, [Prince of Persia for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) and [Lode Runner for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Lode-Runner-Roku), I decided to do the same with the original Arcade version of the iconic [Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong). Different from the other two games, this time I'm remaking the game not porting any part of the original code (Prince is mostly ported and Lode Runner has the AI ported). This projectwas developed based on my observation of the game mechanics and the great amount of information available online, on sites like http://wiki.donkeykonggenius.com/ and http://donkeykongblog.blogspot.com.br/ that describes details of the game to help players develop strategies.

If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install the preview channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/DonkeyKongPreview

The game is feature complete, the levels and boards sequence is followed as the original Arcade (with two options USA and Japan), including the cut scenes. The Jumpman (original name of Mario) can run, jump, get objects, use the hammer and die. Kong animations are in place and the barrels (normal & wild), fire balls and fire foxes AI was implemented. The elevators, conveyors and rivets boards are also done. Bonus countdown and high score records are fully working. You can check the [Changelog](https://github.com/lvcabral/Donkey-Kong-Roku/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to know more details of all implemented features.

The project still has a couple of bugs and few planned enhancements registered at the repository [Issues backlog](https://github.com/lvcabral/Donkey-Kong-Roku/issues), if you want to help feel free to fork it, implement and submit your changes.

To see the game working you can watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA59qZk7fQU) with the functionality up to release v0.10.
