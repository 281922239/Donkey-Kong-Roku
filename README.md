After finishing the remake of two other classic games to Roku platform, [Prince of Persia for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) and [Lode Runner for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Lode-Runner-Roku), I decided to do the same with the original Arcade version of the iconic Donkey Kong. Different from the other two games, this time I want to remake the game not porting any part of the original code (Prince is mostly ported and Lode Runner has the AI ported). I'm developing it based on my observation of the game mechanics and the great amount of information available online, on sites like http://wiki.donkeykonggenius.com/ and http://donkeykongblog.blogspot.com.br/ that describes details of the game to help players develop strategies.

The current state of Alpha version 0.7 has most of the mechanics of the game ready, the levels and boards sequence is followed as the original Arcade, the Jumpman (original name of Mario) can walk, jump and get objects and die. Kong animations are in place, missing only the barrels randomization algorithm. The elevators (with some bugs) and conveyor belts behaviour are also implemented. Bonus countdown and high score records are fully working. You can check the [Changelog](https://github.com/lvcabral/Donkey-Kong-Roku/blob/master/Changelog.md) to know more details.

The missing features (and known bugs) will be added to the repository Issues backlog, but the key missing features are:

* Introduction scene (Kong clibing with Pauline and jumping on top of the barrels board)
* Finish level scene (Kong falling head down and Mario reunited with Pauline)
* Moving ladders (Conveyors board)
* Random obstacles: barrels, fireballs, firefoxes, cement pies, springs
