After finishing the remake of two other classic games to Roku platform, [Prince of Persia for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) and [Lode Runner for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Lode-Runner-Roku), I decided to do the same with the original Arcade version of the iconic Donkey Kong. Different from the other two games, this time I want to remake the game not porting any part of the original code (Prince is mostly ported and Lode Runner has the AI ported). I'm developing it based on my observation of the game mechanics and the great amount of information available online, on sites like http://wiki.donkeykonggenius.com/ and http://donkeykongblog.blogspot.com.br/ that describes details of the game to help players develop strategies.

If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install the preview channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/DonkeyKongPreview

The current state of Alpha version 0.9 has most of the mechanics of the game ready, the levels and boards sequence is followed as the original Arcade, including the cut scenes. The Jumpman (original name of Mario) can walk, jump, get objects and die. Kong animations are in place and the normal and wild barrels algorithm was implemented. The elevators (with some bugs) and conveyor belts behaviour are also done. Bonus countdown and high score records are fully working. You can check the [Changelog](https://github.com/lvcabral/Donkey-Kong-Roku/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to know more details or watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgieXHGXH9A) with the v0.8 functionality.

The missing features (and known bugs) are registered at the repository Issues backlog, but the key missing features are:

* Random obstacles: fire balls, fire foxes, cement pies, jumping springs
* Moving ladders (Conveyors board)
* Settings: Starting Lives, Bonus Live points
